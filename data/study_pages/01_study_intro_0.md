## This study aims to understand how people understand machine learning models and their predictions with the help of explainable AI 

Our Machine Learning Model is trained on a collection of loan application data. 
It can predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.

For example, given an applicant with the following attributes:

- Age: 30
- Gender: Male
- Job-Level: Skilled
- Housing: Free
- Savings Account: Moderate
- Checking Account: Moderate
- Credit Amount: 2862€
- Duration: 36 months
- Purpose: Car

The model would give the prediction that this is a high risk customer and the loan should not be approved.
Such a model can also provide its confidence in the prediction. In this case, the model is 99% confident in its prediction.
